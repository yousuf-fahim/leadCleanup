The partnership was founded by certified orthotists and prosthetists who were dissatisfied with large impersonal corporations where the constant pressures of consolidation and cost containment can hamper effective patient care. In addition, they did not want local patient care decisions to be affected by administrators in some far away corporate headquarters. These professionals wanted to truly make a difference and established a practice based upon their philosophy and management protocol. That philosophy is reflected in the name of our company â€”New England Orthotic & Prosthetic Systems. 

More than a geographic region, New England represents proud traditional values of quality, integrity, dedication, and value for services rendered. These ideals form the basis for New England Orthotic & Prosthetic Systems' vision and strategy of ""putting quality and integrity first"". This is not a marketing slogan, but a fundamental article of faith which connects us to the boundless opportunities available to an organization dedicated to finding solutions to human needs",,101 to 250,,"New England Orthotic and Prosthetic Systems, LLC",+18885518588,,"3842,  5999",71394,Branford,CT,06405,"Health, Wellness & Fitness",,,,,,,3,TERESA ALVAREZ,527 E 15th St,Hialeah,FL,33010,,,D,Y,68,T9,S8,,,,,
