In response, he introduced a then-revolutionary new Bourdon tube pressure gauge. The rest is history.

Products manufactured by Ashcroft Inc. have become the benchmark in pressure and temperature measurement and include gauges, thermometers, switches, transducers, transmitters, instrument isolators and diaphragm seals and control and calibration equipment.

Specified around the world for the most demanding requirements, these instruments are widely recognized under the brand names Ashcroft,® Heise,® Willy,® and Weksler.® And you can find them in wastewater treatment facilities, biotech and pharmaceutical labs, medical applications, semiconductor facilities, refineries, power generation plants, food processing plants, pulp and paper mills, chemical manufacturing plants and the host of support companies that serve these industries.

As the leader in technology and innovation we design new products based on current and emerging market requirements as well as individual customer’s requirements. As the industry leader our “firsts” lead the way with breakthrough new product features and value added benefits for the customer.

Tulsans enjoy 227 days of sunshine a year and an average daily temperature of 61 degrees. The rainfall average is approximately 40 inches, and continually changing conditions occur in the city during all four seasons.

Our city boasts a widely diversified business base, including aerospace, telecommunications, manufacturing, construction, high technology, healthcare, education, transportation and energy.

Tulsa, one of “America’s Most Livable Communities,” is known as the Mecca for arts in Oklahoma. Art deco masterpieces are prevalent in many of our downtown buildings and churches. Spectacular works of art dot the trails of our beautiful River Parks. From the Tulsa Ballet and Tulsa Opera, to Broadway plays and musicals at the Performing Arts Center, to the Philbrook and the largest collection of Western American art at the Gilcrease, Tulsa’s rich cultural legacy greatly enhances our citizen’s quality of life.

The Tulsa Port of Catoosa is acclaimed as one of the largest, most inland river-ports in the United States. The Tulsa International Airport offers direct service to most major U.S. cities and is another important contributor to our economic growth.

Ten higher education facilities serve the metropolitan Tulsa area. Options range from community college and vocational studies to undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs at both public and private universities.",utulsa.edu,10000+,linkedin.com/company/university-of-tulsa,University Of Tulsa,"+19186313075,  +19186312359,  +19186312565,  +19186312947,  +19186312206",1 Billion and Over,"2711, 7381, 8221",541611,Tulsa,Ok,74104,Strategic Management Services,,Executive,Vice-President,,,,,,,,Vp,,EMAIL,JEFFREY ALLEN,523 W 79th Pl,Tulsa,OK,74132,,+19182305455,B,Y,60,T3,E1,,University of Tulsa,9,1611 S Utica Ave,9186312245,https://www.buildzoom.com/contractor/university-of-tulsa,,Y

Bullet Racing has been responsible for incredible advances in the automotive industry, including breaking a world record for converting an FSAE car to run on Compress Natural Gas (CNG). We took the car 770 miles (or 428 laps) in 24 hours, the furthest distance traveled by an FSAE car in any competition, as well as the furthest distance traveled by an FSAE car powered by CNG, and still the first FSAE car to be converted to run on CNG.

Recently, we placed 22nd at FSAE May competition in 2023. In 2022 we finished 11th place at the May FSAE competition in Michigan. The highlight of the event for us was our 2nd place finish in efficiency.

Crossover Community Impact (CCI) is a Christian organization committed to restoring our community through reconciliation, love and justice.

""Hold fast to love and justice"" (Hosea 12:6)

Restoring Our Community
We want to be an agent of change creating a community of choice. We desire to meet the real needs of our community in such a way that we see the community restored and made whole and as a result people will take pride in our community and desire to stay here.

Initially envisioned by Philip Abode, Pastor of Crossover Bible Church, CCI strives to be an outreach arm of the church. We know how central the church is when it comes to bringing true transformation to a community, but we realize one church can't do it alone. It's going to take churches and Christians from north, south, east and west Tulsa all working together as God's hands and feet in our community. We invite you to lock arms and partner with us in Restoring Our Community.",crossoverimpact.org,51 to 100,linkedin.com/company/crossover-community-impact-incorporated,Crossover Community Impact,"+12155238580,  +19188565377,  +19189922822",10 Million to 25 Million,"8099, 8399",813400,Tulsa,Ok,74106,Non-Profit Organizations,,Operations,Director Of Development,linkedin.com/in/rondalyn-a-55362229,940 E 36th St N,,Tulsa,OK,74106,1953,Director,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y

These simple words encapsulate the driving philosophy behind everything we do at C3 Presents. We create, market and produce live experiences, concerts and events — just about anything that makes people stand up and cheer.

C3 is the force behind two of the country’s top music festivals — Austin City Limits Music Festival and Lollapalooza. Every year, each of these festivals attracts more than 200,000 people over a three-day weekend and is staged in beloved greenspaces in the urban heart of its host city.

These events and many others showcase our ability to bring together a complex, broad spectrum of players — all with their own agendas, deadlines, opinions, and needs but also with a vested interest in the event’s success. C3 possesses the depth of expertise and experience to coordinate and maneuver through a major U.S. city’s complex infrastructure amid the massive logistics surrounding high-profile events — from federal entities such as the U.S. Secret Service, to city service agencies including city emergency management offices, the police department, transportation departments, and sanitation department — to political and civic agencies such as mayors’ offices, city tourism boards and parks departments.",c3presents.com,1001 to 5000,linkedin.com/company/c3-presents,C3 Presents,"+15025894215,  +13172723600,  +15032244100,  +19417473011,  +12143584451",250 Million to 500 Million,"1731, 7922",71113,Austin,Tx,78701,Musicians,,,Talent Buyer/ Coordinator,,,,,,,,,,"NAME,ADDRESS",HANNAH WARD,5369 S Irvington Ave,Tulsa,OK,74135,,+19185579205,B,,23,T3,E1,64.210.99.245,C3 Presents,13,300 W 6th St,5122844039,https://www.buildzoom.com/contractor/c3-presents,,Y
